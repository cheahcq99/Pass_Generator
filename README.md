# Pass_Generator
A complex password generator using Python
This program generates a password that is at least as long as the length specified by the user, and includes characters from four different character sets: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation. It ensures that at least one character is selected from each set, and fills the rest of the password with randomly selected characters from all character sets. It then shuffles the password to make it harder to guess.

This method of generating passwords ensures that the resulting password is strong and secure, as it includes characters from different sets and is of sufficient length. Additionally, you can adjust the character sets or the minimum length of the password to suit your needs.
